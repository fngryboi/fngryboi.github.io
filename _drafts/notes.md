A video game that has been forming in my mind for the past 3+ years. That I'm now **officially** going to devote most of my free time to. With this announcement post serving as my go-to link that I'll send to people whenever I'll be busy working on this.

However, for those uninitiated about this little dream game of mine, let me introduce you to it.

## TODO:

- Add a roadmap of sorts
- Research others announcements:
    - Raymond Cripps
    - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCr-5TdGkKszdbboXXsFZJTQ
- Consistent updates
    - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVk763Rfjd8 Devlogs by Raymond Cripps (every 2 weeks ish, together with a sprint and the progress)
- Add a Ko-fi/donations disclaimer, perhaps just have it on the Ko-fi page and not here in socials.md
- Add a mailing list sign up with a message about what it's for and what they can expect https://mailchimp.sendinblue.com/en/?tap_a=30591-fb13f0&tap_s=399365-5deed4 https://moosend.com/blog/mailchimp-alternatives/ https://www.sendinblue.com/features/signup-forms/

- Draw up character art (basically A-pose characters as a reference design)
    - Keep all the art to functional concept art, they serve a purpose and aren't there to be pretty marketing work, at least to begin with.

---

- test compress.html layout from http://jch.penibelst.de/
    - easiest to test by publishing to github pages by copying all the project barkeep files into master as one big push and bringing the history, thus avoiding bringing weird history stuff in there. And then checking the comments inside the disclaimer page.

Not prioritized
- update about me
- https://schema.org/BlogPosting make sure these are in

## First month summary

Even though it's been very exciting finally getting to work on this game project, which I've envisioned in my head for roughly three years by now, the first month has been mostly preparation and organizing. After all, what is a project without a solid workflow foundation. 

Not to forgot preparing social media platforms, changing my blog to highlight this project, preparing at my day job as I went down in to working 6h a day instead of 8h.......

Also, I'd love to hear what tools and programs help you keep track of everything around your projects and ideas......?

By 

As of roughly one month ago today at the time of writing this, I've stepped down to 75% and am no longer working full-time. Which felt a little scary with the current pandemic that's placing everyone under house arrest.

Something I've thought about for the last couple of months leading up to doing it, as up until then I hadn't really had the spare-time to consistently work on one of my game ideas. 

I thought about this long before the current pandemic, where I'm very fortunate to have a job that can be done remotely. But it sort of turned out to be a best of both worlds from what I can tell so far, I've gotten more productive at work since I'm able to have a creative outlet during my spare time.


TODO:

- goal publish date 25th of April
- Write a prep-stage begun post, prep-stage being the first 3 months to really flesh out what this should be and try stuff out to nail down the endgoal.
- Only hint at what the game will be and some minor art pieces added
- The rest of the article will be more focused on how I've set up my own workflow to make my progress more effective and ensure that I stay on track, especially since I've given up some work hours and pay in order to work on this project instead.
- Preparation and what I've done for the first month
  - Books I've read
  - Excel set up to track my progress
  - Keeping track of what to do using Glo Boards
  - Centralizing all of my notes into one place
    - It was *fricking* awful, this is 3+ years of notes that I've kept in various places as my habits have changed over the years.
- Include some A-pose character art

<!--

- Project Barkeep
  - <strike>You are the new bartender at a family-run bar you inherit from an estranged and recently deceased uncle</strike>
  - <strike>Despite your uncles' wishes for the opposite and the occults trying to respect his wishes, you quickly learn that your regular patrons are occult beings with the likes of witches, vampires, zombies, demons and more.</strike>
- Game is about
  - <strike>Mixing drinks ordered by your customers</strike>
    - <strike>Everything from a regular Pi√±a colada to a Bloody Mary (with an optional dash of real blood for the occasional vampire, "ethically" sourced from a local hospital)</strike>
  - <strike>Getting to know your regulars (their tastes, and how that changes with their mood etc.) and their stories that span several lifetimes in some cases, as well as unfolding your family history of barkeepers who have served the very same regulars long before you.</strike>
  - <strike>Unlocking dormant abilities that run in your family</strike>
    - (SPOILER) <strike>You have witch hunter in your blood, and one of your best friends is a witch, which adds a dark part of the story that can be explored.</strike>
  - <strike>Using your awakened abilities you solve mysteries related to occult beings where the regular authorities can't follow up</strike>
    - <strike>You read the news to find weird stories or unsolved cases in the news</strike>
    - <strike>You hear from the patrons (either by them telling you or eavesdropping)</strike>
    - <strike>Mystery solving based on conversations at the bar and looking for clues only you are able to find with your abilities</strike>
    - <strike>Call these specific "bad" occults something catchy, some of them are just bad at the core - others are going through a craze (newly transformed or placed in a craze by someone)</strike>
      - <strike>defectors of the coven/underground society/outlaws of the coven?</strike>
      - (SPOILER) some are worse than others, some left purely for personal reasons rather than to be evil
- Game includes
  - <strike>Branching storylines through</strike>
    - <strike>Actions (even the order you execute them, don't include in live article but have as an idea)</strike>
    - <strike>Dialog options (4th wall breaking depending on which choice you're considering)</strike>
  - <strike>Drink mixing mini game with a skill/memory based point system</strike>
    - <strike>Bonus points for mixing drinks that fit the customers mood/preference</strike>
    - <strike>Bonus points for how you mix the drink</strike>
    - <strike>SSX inspired tricky system except with bottles and alcohol instead of snowboards and hills</strike>
  - Visuals
    - <strike>The environments will be realistic looking, utilizing raytracing where applicable (global illumination or reflections) - through an almost tilt-shift looking perspective, with tasteful and carefully added depth of field and bloom.</strike>
    - <strike>Character visuals will be inspired by stop-motion style movies with the likes of Nightmare before Christmas, and the shading that is similar to that as well but perhaps a more pasty look similar to Do Ya Thing - Gorillaz music video</strike>
