## Artwork

All artwork featured in the contents of an article, unless stated otherwise, are made by me and is copyrighted material.

### Licensing artwork
I'm currently not interested in licensing my artwork for commercial use.

### Layouts
I only approve of using my artwork in layouts if my website link ([https://momeen.me](https://momeen.me)) is visible on the image being used. Please email me (hello@momeen.me) before using my artwork in a website layout to receive explicit approval from me about its use.

### Profile pictures, avatars and icons
You can use my art for your profile picture, avatar, or icon, and I'd really appreciate it if you'd also clearly credit my work. On facebook, please include my name and momeen.me in the image description. On a forum, please include a credit line in your signature. If there is no way to credit me for the image, no need to feel like you can't use it - just be honest when someone asks who made the picture and send them my way by linking to [https://momeen.me](https://momeen.me) or any of my social media accounts <3

### Personal use
Using my image as your desktop wallpaper, printing out a small version for yourself, or any other small-scale personal use is perfectly fine. Just don’t sell my art and/or claim it as your own.

### Reference
Using my artwork as a reference for your own is not a problem. This applies to referencing specific parts of my art as well as 'style borrowing' or trying out elements of my digital painting style. However, I'd really appreciate if you'd link to the image you used as a reference (from one of my platforms) and provide proper credit (with a link to [https://momeen.me](https://momeen.me)). Also, I'd love to see the artwork you make with my art as reference!

### Tattoos
If you'd lay down your own skin as a canvas for my artwork that is absolutely not a problem. Go right ahead! All I ask in return is that you'll send me a photo of your tattoo when you have had it done :3

### Personal use
Using my image as your desktop wallpaper, printing out a version for yourself, or any other small-scale personal use is perfectly fine. Please just don't sell my art or claim it as your own.

### Featuring my art
I'd be very grateful to have my artwork featured on your journal, blog or website. There is no need to ask permission beforehand, rather I feel very humbled that you'd like to share my artwork! Please post my images with a link back to [https://momeen.me](https://momeen.me). Feel free to send a link to the feature at hello@momeen.me or to one of my social media accounts if you like. However, please do not demand that I share the link on my platforms - if you are only featuring my work as a way to get a shout-out on my platforms, please refrain from featuring my work on your site. I only share links on my platforms from my own initiative!

## Downloadable Files

Any downloadable file, including but not limited to pdfs, docs, jpegs, pngs, is provided at the user’s own risk. The owner will not be liable for any losses, injuries, or damages resulting from a corrupted or damaged file.

This policy is subject to change at anytime.
