A quick guide for how to compile the UE4 source code on Windows so you can run it portably without installing Epic Games Launcher.

## Requirements

* You need to have access to the [EpicGames/UnrealEngine](https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine) repository on Github, don't have access? Follow this procedure: [https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/ue4-on-github](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/ue4-on-github)
* A version of Visual Studio (2015 and newer should work, however some of the newer releases might need 2017 or 2019)
* A git client (unless you prefer the terminal)

## Step by step

* Clone the repository and choose the version you want to run by selecting the appropriate branch
* Open your favorite terminal and navigate to the folder you cloned it to
* Type in `setup` and wait for it to finish
* Type in `GenerateProjectFiles` and wait for it to finish, when done you can close down the terminal
* Navigate to `PathToUnrealEngineRepository\Engine\Extras\UnrealVS` and install the UnrealVS extension appropriate for your installation of Visual Studio.
* Once installed you can go back to the root of the repository and open up the project in Visual Studio with the `UE4.sln` solution file
* Right click in the empty UI area next to the Start compile button and click `UnrealVS` in the dropdown.

- Click the cogwheel that's to the right of the newly added UnrealVS toolbar

- A new window opens with various views with all the projects, configurations and platform targets. Inside the Projects view go ahead and select `UE4`, `ShaderCompileWorker` and `UnrealBuildTool` by control-clicking them so you individually select those. Then select `Development Editor`  in the Config view and lastly select Win64 as the platform.

- Grab a beverage while it builds, *it's gonna take a while...*
- Once it's done you can get to the Development Editor by launching UE4.exe found inside the folder `PathToUnrealEngineRepository\Binaries\Win64`

Now you can enjoy developing with Unreal Engine straight from the source code, which in my case became useful as I sometimes use my work laptop for this and don't want to install anything on there that isn't work-related. So now I can relax on the couch and tinker with my projects in UE4 that's running from my external drive on the laptop ðŸ˜„
