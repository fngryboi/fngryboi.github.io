I recently bought my first display tablet, a Wacom One, after reading good reviews on it and having drooled over the Cintiq 16 and 22 for the past few months. I could not justify the price for the Cintiq 16 or 22 as I'm not that proficient with drawing digitally. But the Wacom One felt like a good fit for me so I ended up getting that one.

Above you can see one of the first doodles I did, trying to recreate the cute cats that are often seen in [Heikala's art](https://twitter.com/heikala_art).

After having played around with it for a couple of days and just drawing some simple doodles, I decided to try out Clip Studio Paint that came with the Software Bundle for the Wacom One.

One of the first things I set out to do was figure out how to maximize the workspace between easy access to useful functions and maximizing the drawing area. For which the following video served me well.

## Clip Studio Paint tips I picked up along the way

Beyond just getting started, below you'll find some videos or links to features, tutorials and tips I found along the way as I've been learning:

* First of all, check the display settings in your OS - specifically the scaling. I'm on Windows 10 and the recommended scaling is automatically set to 150%, which means all the UI scales up and as a result you lose a lot of screenspace to UI. So instead I turned it down to 125% - but depending on your eyesight  (and if you feel that the buttons aren't too small) you might even get away with 100% scaling.
* Use the `>>` arrows to hide away panes when you don't need them, very useful when as in my case you're limited to a small screen that everything has to fit into.

* You might have seen a really cool feature where Clip Studio will automagically color in everything with just simple color splotches to work from, here's a video on how that's done:

* Using layers to progress from the sketch to the final piece
