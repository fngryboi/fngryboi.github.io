A video game that has been forming in my mind for the past 3+ years. That I'm now *officially* going to devote most of my free time to. With this announcement post serving as my go-to link that I'll send to people whenever I'll be busy working on this.

However, for those uninitiated about this little dream game of mine, let me bring you up to speed.

## TODO:
- Add a roadmap of sorts
- Woah, it's really happening. I'm actually telling people about this...
- Research others announcements:
 - 
- Consistent updates
