A few days ago I decided to make a melancholy day a little more exciting by taking out my original Xbox, that had been stored in a box under my bed for too long.

The last time I really used it was when I was around 10 years old, my English wasn't good enough to understand any dialogue so I'd stick to the multiplayer games with friends or the games that weren't heavy with dialogue. The Xbox had been modded at one point, and apparently some great work went into it. It got a bigger harddrive, a TSOP chip, new capacitors, latest version of the EvolutionX Dashboard with some applications and emulators. To little old me it didn't exactly click for me what all that allowed me to do, all I knew was that I could backup a game to the Xbox and then turn in the game at a game store and get some money to buy a new game, even though I technically still had the game. Today I obviously regret getting rid of those games, and I'm working on getting them back.

However, the reason I even decided to take the Xbox out for a spin was from watching a video by ModernVintageGamer. Specifically [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7FmelyC70Y) one where he talks about writing code for the Xbox and the Homebrew scene. Once I'd played around with my Xbox and done some more research I came across the subreddit [r/originalxbox](https://www.reddit.com/r/originalxbox/). Where there's a lot of great material on their [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/originalxbox/wiki/index). The first thing I picked up was that the dashboard had an FTP server included, so I downloaded FileZilla to my laptop and connected to the Xbox.

So I decided to clean up everything inside the Dashboard and turn it into my liking, so I did away with the EvolutionX dashboard in favor of UnleashX (because it has more features and better skin support). Changed the skin to one that is as close to the original Xbox dashboard as it could possibly get.


That video inspired me into bringing out my Xbox because at the same time I've just finished a 3D graphics course where I learned to program with DirectX11.

So I could take that which I learned and downgrade it to DirectX8
