As of roughly one month ago today at the time of writing this, I've stepped down to 75% and am no longer working full-time. Something I've thought about for the last couple of months leading up to doing it, as up until then I had't really had the spare-time to consistently work on one of my game ideas. 

I thought about this long before the current pandemic, where I'm very fortunate to have a job that can be done remotely. But it sort of turned out to be a best of both worlds from what I can tell so far, I've gotten more productive at work since I'm able to have a creative outlet during my spare time.


TODO:
- goal publish date 25th of April
- Write a prep-stage begun post, prep-stage being the first 3 months to really flesh out what this should be and try stuff out to nail down the endgoal.
- Include some A-pose character art
