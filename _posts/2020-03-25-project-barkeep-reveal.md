A video game that has been forming in my mind for the past 3+ years. That I'm now **officially** going to devote most of my free time to. With this announcement post serving as my go-to link that I'll send to people whenever I'll be busy working on this.

However, for those uninitiated about this little dream game of mine, let me introduce you to it.

## TODO:

- Add a roadmap of sorts
- Research others announcements:
    - Raymond Cripps
    - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCr-5TdGkKszdbboXXsFZJTQ
- Consistent updates
    - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVk763Rfjd8 Devlogs by Raymond Cripps (every 2 weeks ish, together with a sprint and the progress)
- Add a Ko-fi/donations disclaimer, perhaps just have it on the Ko-fi page and not here in socials.md
- Add a mailing list sign up with a message about what it's for and what they can expect https://mailchimp.sendinblue.com/en/?tap_a=30591-fb13f0&tap_s=399365-5deed4 https://moosend.com/blog/mailchimp-alternatives/ https://www.sendinblue.com/features/signup-forms/
- Migrate over stuff from Trello to Glo Boards/OneNote

---

- Draw up character art (basically A-pose characters as a reference design)
    - Keep all the art to functional concept art, they serve a purpose and aren't there to be pretty marketing work, at least to begin with.

---

- some kinda animated glow or shadow or frame on the project barkeep posts?
    - same animated glow on title in posts? or maybe shadows?
- alternative header colors?
    - figure this out by going on the page.categories contains 'project-barkeep'
