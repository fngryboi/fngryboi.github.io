A video game that has been forming in my mind for the past 3+ years. That I'm now **officially** going to devote most of my free time to. With this announcement post serving as my go-to link that I'll send to people whenever I'll be busy working on this.

However, for those uninitiated about this little dream game of mine, let me introduce you to it.

## TODO:

- Add a roadmap of sorts
- Research others announcements:
    - Raymond Cripps
    - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCr-5TdGkKszdbboXXsFZJTQ
- Consistent updates
    - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVk763Rfjd8 Devlogs by Raymond Cripps (every 2 weeks ish, together with a sprint and the progress)
- Add a Ko-fi/donations disclaimer, perhaps just have it on the Ko-fi page and not here in socials.md
- Add a mailing list sign up with a message about what it's for and what they can expect https://mailchimp.sendinblue.com/en/?tap_a=30591-fb13f0&tap_s=399365-5deed4 https://moosend.com/blog/mailchimp-alternatives/ https://www.sendinblue.com/features/signup-forms/
- Migrate over stuff from Trello to Glo Boards/OneNote

---

- Draw up character art (basically A-pose characters as a reference design)
    - Keep all the art to functional concept art, they serve a purpose and aren't there to be pretty marketing work, at least to begin with.

---

- test compress.html layout from http://jch.penibelst.de/
    - easiest to test by publishing to github pages by copying all the project barkeep files into master as one big push and bringing the history, thus avoiding bringing weird history stuff in there. And then checking the comments inside the disclaimer page.
