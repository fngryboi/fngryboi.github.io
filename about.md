Hi, my name is Casper Strand but online I tend to use the alias "Momeen".

During the day I work as a back-end web developer (with frameworks such as Episerver CMS and inRiver), and during my free time I'm currently spending most of the time on my game project called Project Barkeep ( [you can find the pitch here](/projectbarkeep/2020/04/25/project-barkeep-announcement.html)). It feels a little scary showing this to the world though... ðŸ˜…


I'm a firm believer of the following:

- You should always strive to learn new things
- Necessity is the mother of all inventions
- Don't forget to have fun doing it
- Progress is progress, no matter how fast or "slow"
