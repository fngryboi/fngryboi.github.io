Hi, my name is Casper Strand but online I tend to use the alias "Momeen".

During the day I work as a back-end web developer, and during my free time I'm currently spending most of the time on going public with a to-be-revealed game project of mine (which I'll be writing about right here). However, it feels a little scary showing it to the world... ðŸ˜…

I'm a firm believer of the following:

- You should always strive to learn new things
- Necessity is the mother of invention
- Don't forget to have fun doing it
- Progress is progress, no matter how much or little is done at a time
