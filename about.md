![My Profile Picture](/assets/images/profile.png)

I feel like I need an explanation for my nickname so here goes: My nickname for anything on the Internet has been "fngryboi" for a very long time, and since I have a shirt with the name imprinted from Dreamhack there's no going back. It was originally inspired by "Junkboy", AKA Markus Toivonen, who's known for being the art-designer for Minecraft, as I was a big fan of his pixelart work.

I'm a guy in my early 20s who's studying Game Development at University, with a special fondness for 3D modelling, pixelart and programming. I was exposed to video games, computers and programming very early on in my childhood. It started with learning how to bulld computers, after that I learned how to make websites, then I borrowed a book on how to program with C# and I only got deeper into the rabbit hole from there.

The games I really want to make are either in Virtual Reailty or for retro consoles. Currently I'm trying my hand at making a game for the original Xbox but I'm also working on a few VR game ideas.
