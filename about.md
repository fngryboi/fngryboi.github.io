![My Profile Picture]({{ site.baseurl }}assets/images/profile.png)

I feel like I need an explanation for my nickname so here goes: My nickname for anything on the Internet has been "fngryboi" for a very long time, and since I have a shirt with the name imprinted from Dreamhack there's no going back.
My nickname was originally inspired by "Jnkboy", AKA Markus Toivonen, who's known for being the art-designer for Minecraft, as I was a big fan of his pixelart work during the time I was trying to come up with a nickname (his stuff can be found [here](http://jnkboy.tumblr.com), great stuff!).

I'm a guy in my 20s who's studying Game Development at University, with a special fondness for 3D modelling, pixelart and programming. I was exposed to video games, computers and programming very early on in my childhood. It started with learning how to bulld computers, after that I learned how to make websites, then I borrowed a book on how to program with C# and I only got deeper into the rabbit hole from there.

The games I really want to make are either in Virtual Reailty or for retro consoles. Currently I'm trying my hand at making a game for the original Xbox but I'm also working on a few VR game ideas.

A few of my favorite games of all time include (in no particular order):
 - Oddworld series (Munch's Odyssey, Abe's Odyssey)
 - Halo series (special place in my heart for the 2nd game and Reach)
 - The Legend of Zelda series (Breath of the Wild, Minish Cap, Link to the Past)
 - Overwatch
 - Vanilla + Burning Crusade World of Warcraft
 - GTA series (Vice City, San Andreas, IV, V)
 - Burnout Paradise
 - Stardew Valley
 - Downwell
 - Devil Daggers
 - Street Fighter series (II, IV, Tekken VS Street Fighter)
 - Robo Recall
 - Lone Echo

 *Note: These are just some highlights, I probably forgot to add a bunch of games that definitely deserve a place on the list. But these are just a mixed handful of games from my childhood, games I've spent many hours playing with friends and games that touched me lately...*
